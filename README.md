# Card Game

This is a TIY assignment to create a card game: the game of War. In this game, two players compete against each other. They are each dealt 26 cards (half of a full deck) and they play the cards one at a time. The person with the higher card (Ace being the highest) wins that hand. For this version of the game, we will allow ties to happen, and we will not reshuffle the player's decks. As such, the game is over once all of the cards have been played, and the winner is whomever won the most hands.

The learning objectives is to get more practice with Arrays, Objects, iteration, and composing functions together into larger applications. By the end, we gained a better understanding of creating objects and filling them with properties, using built in Object types, and composing functions together to create complex applications. We also understand how to run tests using a proper testing framework (Mocha) and how to use multiple modules/files in a single application.
